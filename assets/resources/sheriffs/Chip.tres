CharacterDescription = "Chip Heartswell was a plucky little robot growing up in West Donkeytown, but was very bored. It was a one-donkey town, after all. It decided to take up sheriffing to pass the time. Once per fight, due to its robot-y nature, it may stun all Underlings on the map for one turn."
